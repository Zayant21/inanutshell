DESCRIPTION
    The "In a Nutshell" Chrome extension provides several commands that can be used to get responses from the ChatGPT model. These commands are described below:
    
    ::ns 'user prompt'
        Returns a response message consisting of 0-400 tokens. The prompt is the user text.

    ::ns -s 'user prompt'
        Returns a brief response message consisting of 0-100 tokens. The prompt is the user text.

    ::ns -lc 'user prompt'
        Returns a response message consisting of 0-4096 tokens. The prompt is the webpage context + user text.

    ::ns -sum
        Returns a summarized response message consisting of 0-500 tokens. The prompt is the webpage context.

    ::ns -v
        Returns the version of the "In a Nutshell" extension.

    Note that the response messages may vary in length and quality depending on the complexity and specificity of the prompt. The -lc command can provide more accurate and informative responses by including the webpage context in the prompt, while the -sum command can provide a shorter and more digestible summary of the current webpage.
